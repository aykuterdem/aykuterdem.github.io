				<p>An important part of the course includes discussions of a number of papers related to certain research topics. Throughout the semesters, we will read and discuss papers on a broad range of topics. To have fruitful interactions in the class, paper discussions are organized around the different "roles" students play each week: Librarian, Reviewer, Archaeologist, Researcher, Industry R&D Expert, Hacker, and Private Investigator.<p>
						
					<p>To minimize time spent between context switches, <span style="background-color: #d4ff32">students are encouraged to use a shared Google Slide document to include any slides to complement their presentations. Each student should title their slides using a role emoji (e.g. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Aykut) and present their views about 8-10 mins.</span> Note that the slides will act as a mnemonic and should help to clarify your points -- also note that your presentation role determines what you should include in your slides. The only exception are the hackers, who can perform demos using Jupyter notebooks.</p>
					
						<p><b>Grading:</b> 23 points: Throughout the semester we will discuss a total of 10 papers. Each week we will have two parties of students, one party presenting on Thursdays. Hence, each student will be in the presenting role for two of the papers and the non-presenting role for the remaining ones. You can earn up to 9 points each time you present for completing the assignment for your role and presenting it to the class. When you are not presenting, you can earn up to 5 point by completing the non-presenting assignment and by participating in the class through live discussion and questions.</p>

What previous projects might have led to working on this one? What do you think motivated them to work on this project? Feel free to contact the authors, but remember to be courteous, polite, and on-topic. Write that you're in Prof. Aykut's seminar and include a link to this page.</td>

				<p><b>Deadline:</b> You should meet with the instructor before the presentation date (<ul>after the Tuesday lecture that week</ul>) to discuss your slides, and the presentation should be submitted by the night before the class.<br><br></p>
				
				<p>In the Spring 2025 semester, we will read and discuss <a href="readinglist.pdf">these papers</a>.</p>
