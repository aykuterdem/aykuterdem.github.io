Indentation
=============
Writing the code with proper and consistent indentation and spacing rules in crucial for a more readable code. 


Braces
--------
The open brace ({) goes at the end of the line before the start of the code block.
The close brace (}) goes on its own line, indented to match the beginning of the line containing the corresponding open brace, and include a descriptor on the closing brace line that indicates which opening brace it matches.

Code Inside Braces 
------------------
Indent one level for each level of curly braces ({}).

Code Inside conditional statements and loops 
--------------------------------------------
Indent one level for lines of code in conditional statements and loops.

Continued lines 
---------------
When a statement continues across two or more lines, indent the second and remaining lines an equal amount past the start of the first line of the statement.

Parameter Assignments
----------------------
Place the equal characters of multiple assigments in same column of your code. Check the comprehensive example for this.


Example of proper indentation technique:

.. code-block:: c

   int RequestedAmount = INITIAL_AMOUNT;
   int temp            = 200;

   int withdraw (int RequestedAmount) {
      if (Balance < RequestedAmount) {              
         return 0;                                
      }                                                
      else {
         Balance = Balance - RequestedAmount;
         printf("Withdrawal of %4.2f
                           successful, leaving %4.2f.",
                           RequestedAmount, Balance);             
         return 1;
      }                                                
   }
